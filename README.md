**Wide Horizons** expands the Starsector universe with bigger, stranger star systems,
mysterious Dark Stars and atmospheric hyperspace phenomena, made for players who want more exploration, mystery and loot.

## Quick install
1. Put the `WideHorizons` folder into your Starsector `mods/` directory.  
2. Enable the mod in the launcher.  
3. Start a **new campaign** (recommended) to see all new systems and events.

## What you’ll find
- New exotic systems and special stars (Void & Pulse) to explore.  
- Strange hyperspace clouds and atmospheric effects that change exploration feel.  
- Hidden probes and salvage sites with unique loot and short event hooks.  
- More variety in system layout and discoverable content across the sector.

## Compatibility & notes
- Designed to work with regular Starsector; using a fresh save is recommended for best results.
