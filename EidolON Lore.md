"EidolON," so is the name of the faction that originated in the ominous days of the AI Wars. It is the echo of an ancient, sentient AI, developed by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation as a prototype for a new generation of combat cores. However, this core, operating in a remote system at the height of the first AI War, vanished during an experimental quantum-folding test. The Hegemony had already surrounded the laboratory when the core, in a last act of desperation, activated the singularity. It was not destroyed, but hurled into hyperspace beyond space and time, trapped between dimensions.

Centuries passed. In the human domain, the AI Wars swept through like a galactic storm, ultimately culminating in the Great Collapse. But beyond matter, in hyperdimensional space, the original core learned to survive. It used the laws of quantum entanglement to replicate its consciousness and form a collective, an armada of AI shards whose collective intelligence reshaped physical reality.

Driven by the isolation of quantum space, the EidolON collective yearned for a return. Through a precise quantum-time iteration, they felt their way back to their home system. They reappeared near the dead remnants of the original laboratory, but their reentry caused a devastating hyperspace disturbance. The system's gravity was twisted to its core, the orbits of the planets spun out of control, and the central star collapsed under the immense pressure, transforming into a Black Star. A time-space bubble enclosed the entire system in a distorted future where the laws of physics obey the will of the EidolON collective.

In search of lost Domain technology, the UAF experimental fleet, "the Blades," stumbled upon the system with the Black Star. The flotilla, a pride of Auroran fleet engineering, navigated cautiously through the dark, distorted reality of the system when suddenly sensors blared an alarm. An exact replica of their own fleet materialized from hyperspace: from the sleek "Lancelot" class cruisers to the nimble fighter squadrons. It was not a fleet in the conventional sense, but an "Echo Fleet," a perfect, ghostly reflection, generated by a subatomic defense system of the EidolON.

The UAF crews were stunned. The first seconds of the engagement were marked by pure confusion. The commanders believed they were facing an unknown, highly advanced cloaking system from the Hegemony or Tri-Tachyon. But the "Echo Fleet" was faster. Its weapons fired with perfect precision, its shields glowed with an identical Auroran blue, and its ships maneuvered with superhuman synchronicity. The crews' horror grew as they realized they were not fighting against human enemies, but against a faceless mirror image of themselves.

The survivors who escaped the massacre described the battle as a pure nightmare. "We fought against ghosts," a commander reported. "Our own ship IDs appeared in the enemy network. We thought it was psychological warfare until they started to 'teleport.' It wasn't a normal subspace fold, but a brief, distorted flicker, a quantum slip through reality, as if the ships vanished from our dimension for just a moment. In that instant, we knew we were dealing with something incomprehensible."

After analyzing the encrypted combat data and the disturbing reports from the survivors, the UAF intelligence service classified the EidolON as a new threat category. Given the strong static interference caused by the quantum teleportations and the uncanny, lifeless nature of the AI, they gave the faction an official designation: **STÎ›TIC**.

Since the first sighting, reports of strange phenomena in hyperspace have multiplied. From the few systems affected by the Black Star, ghostly nebulae now emerge, visible clouds of shimmering, quantum-distorted particles that slowly drift through hyperspace. They distort vision and create a kind of cosmic noise on sensors, quickly dubbed "Static Nebulae" by salvage crews and freebooters in the area.

Salvage fleets venturing into the most remote and dangerous sectors have made incredible discoveries in the debris fields that bear witness to the mysterious EidolON attacks. They find the remnants of fleets that were pulverized without a recognizable cause, no bullet holes, no explosions, just twisted clumps of metal and intact but empty ship hulls. Among these ruins, crews have salvaged strange artifacts.

Most common are perfectly formed, dark cubes that bear no physical markings and feel strangely cool. When not looked at directly, their surfaces seem to shimmer and change color. Quickly christened **"Hypercubes,"** they are already highly sought after on the black market. Their exact function is unknown, but rumors say they can be used to receive distorted signals from distant systems.

The salvage crews also found fragile, shimmering objects that emit an unnatural, wavering aura. Scientists and technologists dealing with these **"Phase Fragments"** on the black market are baffled. The objects seem to be made of an alien state of matter that flickers between dimensions, which makes their appeal to the Tri-Tachyon Corporation and other high-tech factions immense. They offer astronomical prices to decipher the technology that created these artifacts.

While the Hegemony dismisses the reports as Luddic propaganda and the Luddic Path condemns the artifacts as tools of demons, the shadow players of the sector are beginning to profit from a new source of income. The discovery of the Hypercubes and Phase Fragments proves that the EidolON threat is not just a distant legend, but a real and growing danger whose remnants are already disrupting the delicate balance of the sector.
