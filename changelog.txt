Version 1.0.1 (Mai 2025)
Improved Compatibility with RAT Mod:
  You can now choose whether to use universe generation settings from the "Random Assortment of Things" (RAT) mod or stick with Wide Horizons' own settings.
  This is fully configurable in-game via the LunaLib mod options menu.

Dynamic Universe Settings - No Restart Needed:
  Changes to galaxy size, number of star systems, gate density, and other settings are now applied immediately - no need to restart or reload.
  Make your adjustments in LunaLib and see the effects instantly in your next new game.

Smarter Galaxy Scaling:
  Sector size, system count, ruins, Remnant presence, and more now scale dynamically using a centralized "WH Scale" setting.
  This ensures consistent balance and flexibility for both small and massive universes.

Under-the-Hood Improvements:
  New plugin added to manage settings initialization and dynamic updates.
  Clean separation between RAT and Wide Horizons setting logic.
  Improved mod compatibility by exposing key galaxy values globally.

  This update lays the groundwork for a more modular and customizable Wide Horizons experience.
  Whether you prefer RAT's universe balance or Wide Horizons' handcrafted structure - now it's up to you.

Version 1.0.3 (Juni 2025)
Bug Fixes:
  - Fixed Hyperspace Map Scaling.
    The hyperspace terrain now correctly matches the galaxy size, especially in larger sectors.
  - No More Stars Leaking into the Abyss.
    Fixed an issue where some star systems (especially when using RAT) would spawn too close to or inside the Abyss region of the map.
  - Improved Compatibility with Exotic Mods.
    Previously, certain modded stars (e.g. from Bultach Coalition) caused crashes due to missing or unsupported star data.
    Wide Horizons now includes a fallback system to handle these cases gracefully - and logs helpful messages if something unusual is detected.
  - Crash Fixes for Extreme Settings.
    Fixed crashes that could occur when generating very large galaxies or using unrealistic system size values.
  - Savegame-Safety Improvements.
    Additional compatibility work was done to reduce the risk of corrupted savegames when using other large content mods alongside Wide Horizons.

New Content & Features:
  - Upgraded Hyperspace Generation.
    Visuals and layout of the hyperspace layer are now more immersive and better scaled for expanded galaxies.
  - Bigger Star Systems.
    Systems can now be generated with more planets and expanded layouts - offering a greater sense of scale.
  - Mysterious Dark Star Systems.
    A new type of system with unique effects and dark cosmic themes has been introduced. Can you find them?
  - Refined Galaxy Layout.
    Adjusted system placement, scaling, and distribution - laying the foundation for upcoming content and themes.

Note:
  Wide Horizons is still in active development - feedback and crash reports are appreciated!
  Make sure you use the LunaLib in-game menu to customize your universe size, content density, and system behavior.

Version 1.0.4 (Juli 2025)
Bug Fixes:
  - Auto mode reworked: Wide Horizons is now fully compatible with RAT in Auto mode.
    You now get both contents combined - RAT's sector logic plus all unique systems and features from Wide Horizons.
  - Abyss zone fixed: Stars will no longer spawn inside the Abyss.
    The zone now also scales properly with larger sectors.
  - Hyperspace cloud generation improved:
    Cloud and nebula distribution has been rebalanced for larger maps, offering better navigation and more natural density.
  - Protection against invalid settings:
    New safety checks now prevent incorrect or illogical values (e.g. for sector size or grid setup) from breaking the game or causing performance issues.

Version 1.0.5 (Juli 2025)
Improved Compatibility with Popular Mods:
  Wide Horizons now detects fixed-position systems from many popular mods and repositions them correctly in the expanded sector.

    - Better placement in the enlarged galaxy
    - No more off-map or clipped systems
    - A cleaner and more immersive sector map

Abyss adjustments:
  - Star systems no longer spawn inside the Abyss
  - Abyss region now scales with sector size

Hyperspace cloud improvements:
  - More visible paths across large maps
  - Natural cloud distribution for better immersion

Note: These changes apply only to new savegames, since hyperspace is generated on game start. It's a visual improvement - gameplay is unaffected.

Bugfix: Invalid star types
  - Mods using non-standard star types (e.g., star_purple) previously caused crashes during system expansion.
  - Wide Horizons now replaces invalid stars with compatible types, or safely skips affected systems with proper logging.

Settings safety checks:
  - Sector width, grid size, and other values are now validated
  - Broken or extreme settings are corrected automatically

Version 1.0.6 (Juli 2025)

Core System Architecture Rework:

Foundation Rebuilt for Large-Scale Sector Support
  The internal structure for star system placement, registration, and alignment has been completely reworked.
  WideHorizons now uses a centralized framework to accurately reposition systems—Vanilla and modded—alongside their content, terrain, and static entities.

Content-Aware Positioning
  Systems are no longer just moved by coordinates: all attached entities (e.g., planets, stations, derelicts) are repositioned intelligently as part of the system structure.
  This ensures thematic consistency and visual accuracy across the entire sector.

Integrated Hyperspace Coordination
  Hyperspace terrain is now automatically adjusted around repositioned systems.
  Clearing logic respects final system locations and is synchronized with terrain generation, preventing fog collisions or obscured entrances in large sectors.

Fixed Position System Framework
  A new utility layer handles persistent placement of star systems across game sessions.
  Mod systems are only repositioned if they exist and are detected, ensuring safe and dynamic support for a wide range of external content.

Version Checker Integration
  WideHorizons now supports the Version Checker.
  You’ll be notified in the main menu whenever a new version of WideHorizons is available—no more guessing or missing important updates.

Fixed: Some systems (e.g. Mayasura) had misaligned stations, gates, or relays after being moved in the larger sector.
  - This was caused by entities using fixed setLocation(...) coordinates without orbits, which did not follow the moved system center.
  - Solution: All non-orbital system entities (e.g. gates, beacons, custom stations) are now automatically attached to their system’s star and follow correctly when the system is repositioned.
  - Also excluded dynamic entities (like scanners, spawners or patrol anchors) from being locked to system centers, preserving intended behaviors.

Bugfixes and Improvements:
  – Fixed crash caused by mismatched tile string length
  – Prevented abyss regions from being overwritten during refill
  – Added tile length validation for safe terrain initialization
  – Reduced duplicate clearing calls for better performance
  – Added terrain auto-initialization fallback

Improvements & Fixes:

Hyperspace Terrain Clearing and Refilling:
  Now the mod properly clears hyperspace nebula (“fog”) only around registered star systems and safely refills those areas on load. This prevents unwanted fog edits and improves navigation and visibility in a larger sector.

System Repositioning Stability:
  Star systems and their static entities are now consistently registered and repositioned based on saved coordinates, ensuring stable layouts after loading or sector generation. All non-orbital entities are auto-attached to the system’s star.

Developer Mode Logging:
  All internal logs are now gated behind Developer Mode. You’ll only see detailed debug output if DevMode is active, keeping the log clean during normal gameplay.

Central Logging via WHDevLogger:
  A new WHDevLogger utility handles all info, warn, and error output. It ensures consistent formatting, centralized control, and dev-mode-only output where appropriate.

Bugfixes and Internal Improvements:
  – Fixed duplicate position updates caused by redundant system re-registration
  – Ensured proper initialization of hyperspace terrain during generation and load
  – Improved handling of abyss tiles to prevent invalid terrain overwrite
  – Logging now includes tile debug info (before/after) for clear diagnostics
  – Automatically skips auto-fix of dynamic entities to preserve AI and script behavior

What This Means for Players
  – Clearer and more immersive hyperspace visuals around key systems
  – Stable and reliable sector layout during both new game and reload
  – Minimal log clutter unless actively debugging
  – Improved performance and compatibility with terrain-related mods

Accurate System ID Matching
  System detection is now based on the actual Starsector-internal IDs, ensuring precise registration regardless of name capitalization or localization.
  Mods using duplicate system names (e.g., “Acheron”) are handled cautiously to avoid conflicts.

Duplicate System Protection
  Systems with identical IDs from multiple mods (like SCY and DPL) are safely checked before repositioning.
  Only one version is moved - whichever was actually created - preventing layout bugs or invisible systems.

Mod Detection-Based Placement
  Fixed system positioning is now fully conditional: systems are only repositioned if the corresponding mod is detected.
  This avoids errors and maintains a clean layout for each user’s mod setup.
