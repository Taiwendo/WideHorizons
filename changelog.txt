Version 1.2.9b (August 2025)

Core Systems & Universe Scaling
	Improved Galaxy Scaling: the sector now scales consistently in both axes using a new elliptical factor.
	The sector size is only set when starting a new game (never mid-save), which fixes the misaligned Intel/click areas on the map.
	Safe Defaults: if you enter invalid galaxy settings (width, height, cell size, constellation count), the game will automatically fall back to vanilla values, avoiding crashes or huge performance drops.

Exploration & Discovery
	Stable Exploration Mode: Discovery scripts now pause when a dialog is open (Fleet Detachment from Industrial Evolution).
	This prevents rare crashes and preserves the integrity of hidden systems.
	Star & Planet Discovery Fixes: hidden systems are no longer revealed at the wrong time, and core worlds remain visible.
	Discovery notifications and map reveals are deferred until it's safe to show them.
	Improved Compatibility: a new listener (WHDialogMemoryPatcher) injects a valid memory map into certain dialog plugins to prevent null-pointer crashes caused by other mods.
	This helps ensure smooth interactions when multiple mods run together.

Systems & Colonies
	Unique Planet IDs: fixed a long-standing bug where two planets could share the same internal ID, causing one colony to vanish from the colony tab.
	Planets now get guaranteed unique IDs at generation time, and any duplicates are automatically corrected.
	Spindle System Fix: the Spindle system is repositioned correctly after scaling, and hyperspace terrain around it is cleared and refilled to match its new location.

User Interface
	Intel & Map UI Alignment: resolved an issue that caused click regions of Intel pop-ups to extend far into the screen when using non-vanilla sector sizes.
	Buttons and lists now behave reliably regardless of sector scale.
	Prevented Mid-Game Desyncs: changing sector size settings in the middle of a campaign no longer disrupts the UI - settings only apply when you start a new game.

Stability & Compatibility
	Crash-to-Desktop Fixes: addressed a rare crash when picking up stranded fleets in hyperspace while exploration mode was active.
	Wide Horizons now coordinates with dialog systems to avoid null references.
	Better Logging: improved log messages and warnings to help diagnose issues if they occur, without spamming the player with unnecessary information.
	Cross-mod Support: numerous under-the-hood improvements make Wide Horizons more compatible with major mods like Industrial Evolution, Nexerelin and Random Assortment of Things.

Performance improvements for Dark Star visual effects
	Optimized the glow-mote effects around Void and Pulse Stars.
	These effects will now only run while you are inside the system.
	When you leave the system, they stop cleanly to avoid unnecessary background load.
	This reduces stutter and improves performance in large mod setups.

Version 1.2.9a (August 2025)

UI Fix Update
    Fixed a bug where the Intel and map UI could become misaligned when using non-vanilla sector sizes (clicks registering offset from visuals).
    Sector scaling values are now only applied during new game generation. They will no longer change in the middle of an active save, preventing UI desync issues.
    Improved internal validation of galaxy settings (cell size, constellation size, sector dimensions) to fall back to safe vanilla values if invalid numbers are detected.
    Vanilla Core System Scale adjustments.

Version 1.2.9 (August 2025)

New added:
    Wide Horizons Scaling API, more on this in the guide.

    Added a new Performance tab in the LunaLib settings.
    Explains which options have the biggest impact on FPS, CPU, or RAM.
    Includes clear [highlighted] notes and recommended presets (Balanced / Performance / Exploration+).
    Improved settings tooltips with clearer formatting and color highlights for important information.

    Added an option to switch between Strange/Blue Hyperspace and the original vanilla blue hyperspace clouds.
    If Strange Hyperspace is turned off, all clouds will now use the classic vanilla textures.
    Fixed save/load handling so hyperspace visuals stay consistent across saves.

    A few general improvements to Procen.

Version 1.2.8 (August 2025)

Added new settings for the Hyperspace Abyss in the Galaxy tab.
Abyss Size Coupling: controls how much the dark Abyss at the edges of the map scales with the overall galaxy size.
Abyss Edge Fade: controls how quickly the Abyss darkness fades in at the very edge of the map.
Default values keep the same behavior as before. Advanced players can now fine-tune how big or small the Abyss feels in larger or smaller galaxies.

Visual Effects:
    Pulse Star and Void Star mote effects are now registered only once per system.
    Improved performance: motes idle when the player is not in the system instead of running constantly.

Discovery System:
    Fixed duplicate registration of the discovery plugin after loading a save.
    Added safeguards so each entity (jump points, anchors, beacons etc.) is only marked as discovered once.
    Prevented double-triggering during discovery, improving stability.
    Intel messages and XP rewards are now shown only the first time you discover a system or beacon.

General Stability:
    Reduced risk of slowdown after saving and reloading campaigns.
    Overall smoother exploration and map visibility updates.

Version 1.2.7fix (August 2025)

Fixes & Improvements
    Adjusted procedural generation so all themed content (Remnants, Ruins, Cryosleepers, Motherships, Coronal Taps) now scales correctly with sector size.
    Fixed incorrect scaling in certain theme generators that caused too few or too many points of interest in large sectors.
    Warning beacons and other theme-related POIs now match intended density for different sector sizes.
    Improved internal diagnostics for better POI counting and scaling verification.
    Savegame, no longer crashes with the theme error.

Version 1.2.7 (August 2025)

Added New Runtime Diagnostics Command
    You can now use the console command whdiag_runtime to check what’s actually spawned in your sector - live, without reloading.
        This includes:
            Sector size & hyperspace grid info
            Storm penalty status & Abyss detection
            Remnant systems & Nexus stations
            Warning Beacons (low/med/high)
            Research stations, mining stations, supply caches, and other caches
            Domain probes & survey ships
            Hypershunts & cryosleepers
    Add details to the command (e.g. whdiag_runtime details) to see where some of these were found.

Fixed:
    Save compatibility: This update is load-safe but not retroactive.
    The new worldgen content (research/mining stations, domain probes/survey ships, hypershunts) appears on new games only.
    Existing saves are unaffected.
    Systems with inhabited, visible markets remain shown from the start; all other systems must still be explored before appearing.
    Abyss regions now correctly apply speed, sensor, and visibility penalties even when hyperspace storms are disabled.

Version 1.2.6 (August 2025)

Discovery System Update
    Improved save compatibility: discovered systems and jump points are now stored reliably in the save file.
    Fixed an issue where some systems would always appear visible, even if undiscovered.
    Systems are now only revealed if they have a visible market or you’ve discovered their jump anchor.
    Entering a system or discovering its jump point will now correctly unlock it on the map.

Fixed hyperspace toggle: "Strange Hyperspace: Off" now shows vanilla blue clouds everywhere as intended.
Setting is read more reliably from the options, so your choice is consistently applied on new games/loads.

Version 1.2.5 (August 2025)

Added two new scaling settings for galaxy generation
    Constellation Scaling Exponent - adjusts constellation count relative to sector size.
    POI Scaling Exponent - adjusts amount of points of interest (Remnants, Ruins, Cryosleepers, etc.) relative to sector size.

System Expansion Fixes & Improvements
    Improved constellation relocation: Randomly generated mod constellations are now detected and correctly moved to their intended positions.
    Better compatibility: Fixed an issue where certain constellations (e.g., Magellan, HMI systems) were not being shifted as expected.
    Consistent hyperspace clearing: Clearing around registered constellations now works the same way as for fixed systems.

Version 1.2.4 (August 2025)

Patch Notes (Discovery & Anomalies)
    Fixes
        Resolved a rare crash during exploration checks (ConcurrentModificationException).
        Discovered systems now stay discovered across reloads and setting changes.
        "Discovery Mode: Off" now behaves like pure vanilla (no auto-reveal, nothing gets hidden).

    Improvements
        Added a safety pass that re-validates discovered jump anchors when loading a save.
        Tuned default discovery settings for better performance (slower checks, vanilla visibility range).
        Warning beacons can still add intel entries (optional setting).

    Anomalies
        Void Star: sensor-disruption message now only appears in the same location and is throttled to prevent spam;
        sensor penalty is cleaned up when leaving range/area.
        Pulse Star: pulses start with a short random delay after entering the system, burst interval is randomized,
        messages are throttled, and states reset cleanly after save/load.

    Compatibility
        Safe to install mid-save.
        If some jump points look odd: toggle "Hide Procgen Systems" Off - On once to refresh visibility.

Version 1.2.3fix (August 2025)

Hotfix:
    Hotfix for save game issues and lunalib settings error

Version 1.2.3 (August 2025)

Slipstream Fix
    Safe re-enable: Turning slipstreams back On restores exactly one vanilla manager with a gentle start (no burst spawns).
    Savegame cleanup: Existing saves get a one-time migration that deduplicates managers/terrains and aligns them to your toggle.

    No more duplicates: Fixed an issue where multiple managers could run at once, causing 2–3 more slipstreams.
    Performance/stability: No per-frame overhead; cleaner hyperspace state.
    (If another mod hard-overrides slipstreams, behavior may vary)

Version 1.2.2 (August 2025)

Discovery & Stability Update
    New option - Hide uninhabited systems: When enabled, only uninhabited (incl. modded/non-procgen) systems are hidden until you discover them.
        Inhabited/core systems remain on the map.
    Crash fixes: Resolved errors from missing LunaLib settings and rare star-type issues during world gen.

New:
    Disable Hyperspace Storms option.
    Turns off storm penalties & lightning strikes and hides storm visuals/sounds.
    Regular deep hyperspace clouds still render (for navigation vibes).
    Only the storm effects and VFX/SFX are removed.

Performance:
    Clean implementation without per-frame overhead - no FPS drops.
    Toggle-friendly: Can be switched mid-save. (If another mod also edits hyperspace visuals, results may vary.)

Fixed a rare crash during new-game generation caused by certain modded star types (e.g. “Helia”, “black_hole_secret”).
    Systems with unsupported star types are now safely skipped during expansion instead of causing a crash.
    Improved stability when adding extra planets/moons to vanilla systems.
    Removed a step that could conflict with some star specs, reducing edge-case errors.
    Added graceful fallback: if expansion fails, the game retries with fewer bodies instead of erroring out.
    No visual changes to modded stars; their systems remain as intended by their mods.
    Existing saves are unaffected. Start a new game to see the expansion with this fix.

Version 1.2.1 (August 2025)

Hotfix (systems expansion & settings)
    Crash fix on New Game: Resolved a rare crash caused by exotic star types from other mods. We no longer touch or replace stars;
    expansion now safely proceeds using neutral star data when needed.
    Better mod compatibility: Stars added by other mods are never replaced. Wide Horizons only adds extra planets/moons to existing systems.
    Stable system expansion: Removed risky calls on stars and improved error handling. If something fails, the mod retries with smaller batches instead of breaking.
    Settings toggles fixed: Discovery options now use ON/OFF correctly and won’t spam the log with missing-value errors.
    Cleaner logs: Reduced warning noise; important messages remain.

Note: Effects apply to new games (world generation). Existing saves are unchanged.

Version 1.2.0 (August 2025)

Important - Not Save-Compatible
This version changes world generation and hyperspace terrain. Existing saves may fail to load or exhibit missing systems/visual glitches.
Recommended: Remove the old version, install the update, and start a new game. If you want to finish a current run, stay on the previous release.

Wide Horizons - Discovery & Slipstream Settings:
    Highlights
        Simple On/Off toggles: All Discovery options now use clear Off/On switches in LunaLib.
        Discovery truly optional: Turning Discovery = Off immediately restores visibility of all procgen systems (no more "empty map" if you switch it off).
        Slipstreams toggle: New Disable Slipstreams = Off/On. When On, vanilla slipstreams are suppressed.

    Discovery (new options)
        Enable Discovery (Off/On): Master switch for the feature.
        Hide Procgen Systems (Off/On): Generated systems stay hidden until their hyperspace jump anchor is found.
        Discovery Radius: 0 = use normal sensor visibility; >0 = fixed detection range.
        Check Interval (Min/Max): Performance tuning for how often discovery checks run.
        Jump Anchor Sensor Profile: Higher = anchors are easier to spot on sensors.
        Discovery XP: XP gained when discovering something (set to 0 to disable).
        Show “Discovered” Message (Off/On): Toggle the small pop-up.
        Discover in Hyperspace / Inside Systems (Off/On): Where discovery runs.
        Only Procgen Systems (Off/On): Keep hand-placed systems vanilla.
        Beacons Create Intel (Off/On): Auto-add intel when discovering warning beacons.

    Defaults
        Discovery is Off by default.
        Hide Procgen Systems is On (effective only if Discovery is On).
        Slipstreams are enabled by default (Disable Slipstreams = Off).

Where to change this
    In-game: Settings from Wide Horizons in Discovery.

Compatibility
    Safe to toggle mid-save. Settings apply instantly; visibility and scripts update on the fly.

Patch Notes - Slipstream Control Update
    New Option: You can now disable all slipstreams via mod settings (LunaLib).
    Improved Compatibility: This is fully compatible with both vanilla and modded games.
Look for the Disable Slipstreams toggle in the Galaxy Settings tab!

Strange Hyperspace (WIP)
    New: Added Strange Hyperspace a revamped hyperspace with distinct purple/blue regions and tweaked storm/deep-cloud behavior.
    Toggleable: You can turn it On/Off in Settings from WideHorizons in Strange Hyperspace. (Default: On)
    When Off: Hyperspace reverts to the classic (blue) look & vanilla-like behavior.

Heads-up
    WIP: Balancing, visuals, and effects are still in progress. Expect updates soon with new effects and new content tied to Strange Hyperspace.
    Applying changes: For the cleanest result after switching On/Off, reload your save or start a new game (some visuals don’t fully swap mid-session).

Known (for now)
    Mid-session toggles may not recolor existing clouds immediately.

Wide Horizons Update - ProcGen & Settings Overhaul:
    RAT Integration Removed
        Wide Horizons always uses its own procedural generation, even if the RAT mod is active.
    Simplified Settings
        The mod now automatically scales all world generation values based on your selected Galaxy Size (e.g., 150%, 200%).
        Most users only need to change this one setting everything else adjusts automatically.
    Smarter Auto Scaling
        Settings like constellation count, gate placement, and Cryosleeper number will now scale properly when left on Auto.

New Tabs & Organization:
    Settings have been reorganized into categories like:
    Galaxy, System Generation, Gates & Travel, Advanced
    Easier to navigate, easier to understand!

System Expansion Fixes & Improvements:
    Improved how existing star systems are expanded with additional planets.
    Fixed a rare crash when a system used an unknown or invalid star type.
    If a star cannot be recognized, a valid fallback type is now automatically used.
    More robust support for systems from other mods - including old saves and removed content.
    This ensures better stability and more variety across the sector.

Version 1.1.4hotfix (August 2025)

Hotfix - Planet & Star Descriptions:
    Changes:
        All procedurally generated systems (Hegemony, Luddic Church, Independent, Persean League, Tri-Tachyon) now assign proper planet and star descriptions.
        Each planet, moon, and star now uses lore-friendly tooltips similar to vanilla behavior.
    Resolved issue where unexplored planets or stars showed "No description available".
    Tooltip names now match actual planet names, improving immersion and consistency.

Version 1.1.4 (August 2025)

Wide Horizons now supports Customizable Star Systems (CSS) natively:
    If you use Customizable Star Systems, Wide Horizons will automatically detect and scale any custom systems you define.
    Systems are matched using either:
        the star’s "name" (first star entity in your JSON)
        or the coordinates provided in "setLocation": [x, y]
    No config changes are needed on your part - it just works™.
Note: Systems without a name and without setLocation can’t be detected. To ensure proper support, please include at least one of those fields.

System Position Fixes:
    The following star systems were slightly repositioned to better fit the sector layout:
        Pascal - adjusted position
        Osmium - fixed incorrect spawn location
        Vanadium - aligned with intended coordinates
    These changes improve map consistency and system placement.

System Name Overhaul:
    We've updated and refined system names across several factions to improve immersion, uniqueness, and compatibility with Starsector's universe. Here's what changed:
    All system names are now completely unique - no more overlaps with Vanilla Starsector systems.
    Faction-specific naming themes improved:
        Persean League systems now follow a classical, Mediterranean-inspired style.
        Tri-Tachyon systems use sleek, high-tech names with a synthetic, futuristic tone.
        Luddic Church systems embrace a religious and spiritual naming theme with biblical undertones.
        Independents feature diverse and neutral names that reflect their free and decentralized nature.
        Hegemony systems are now named with strong, militaristic titles befitting their authoritarian character.
    For the Vanilla extension systems.

System Descriptions Update:

    Added unique lore-based descriptions for all custom star systems introduced by Wide Horizons.
    No more “No description… yet” placeholders every major system now features immersive background text in the tooltip and Intel Codex.
    Systems such as Doria, Alecto, Eidyn, Kazeron, Eventide, Vellian, Sarnor,
    and both Void and Pulse Dark Star systems now include detailed flavor reflecting their theme and role in the sector.
    Descriptions appear when hovering over the system or when viewing it in the Codex.
    These changes are purely cosmetic and do not affect gameplay or system content - just world flavor and immersion.

Version 1.1.3 (July 2025)

New content:
    New custom start story introduction when starting as a UAF prototype fleet.
    (This custom start serves as a WIP for the actual content later on)

World Generation Update:
    The game now chooses different types of hidden content (like ruins, derelicts, and Remnants) based on your selected sector generation mode:
        If you're using Auto or WideHorizons mode you'll get the custom WideHorizons content
        If you select RAT mode only RAT content will appear

    This makes sure the hidden parts of the galaxy match the style of the sector you picked

    Added new mod systems
        Kyeltziv Technocracy
        HMI Supervillains
        Foundation Of Borken

Fixed:
    The in-faction accessibility bonus (accessibilitySameFactionBonus) is now properly applied to AI-created colonies (e.g. in Vayra's Sector or Nexerelin).
    This ensures that new colonies from the same faction receive the intended accessibility boost for shared imports.

    Fixed an issue where the Spindle system from ScalarTech was incorrectly positioned when using Wide Horizons.
    The system is now properly scaled and placed according to your selected universe size.

Info:
    If you have systems from MODs that are not yet scaled correctly, please let me know which MOD and which system.

Version 1.1.2 (July 2025)

New adjustments:
    New mod systems have been added.
    A complete list of supported mod systems can be found in the forum in the main post.

Bug fix:
    Some systems have been adjusted from their position as they were incorrect.
    Some random systems have been adjusted.

Info:
    If you have systems from MODs that are not yet scaled correctly, please let me know which MOD and which system.

Version 1.1.1 (July 2025)

Improved:
    New MOD systems are supported.

Bugfix:
    Some systems have been fixed with the position.

Info:
    If you have systems from MODs that are not yet scaled correctly, please let me know which MOD and which system.

Version 1.1.0 (July 2025)

Important Note - New Save Required!
    Due to core changes to sector generation and terrain, this update is NOT compatible with existing saves.
    You MUST start a new game for everything to work correctly!
    Old saves may lead to missing systems, crashes, or mod errors.

New Feature:
    Automatic Core World Scaling
    Core systems like Corvus and Askonia now scale automatically with the rest of the sector
    when the “Core World Scaling” option is set to “Auto” in LunaSettings.
    You can also choose fixed values like 150%, 200%, etc., or keep the Vanilla size if preferred.

Bugfix:
    The vanilla Limbo system and the GateHauler mission now spawn correctly and no longer appear multiple times.
    (Abyss detection and tagging now work just like in unmodded Starsector.)
    Some special systems (e.g. HMI Manchester, Lost Sector Enigma) were not repositioned properly. Now tracked correctly.

Sector Terrain:
    The new, expanded hyperspace terrain is now technically based on Starsector’s original system.
    This ensures full compatibility with other mods like Nexerelin and RAT, even on large sector maps.

Stability:
    Improved loading times and fewer errors when starting a new game.

Accessibility Scaling Fix:
    Colony accessibility is now adjusted for larger sectors.
    In vanilla, colonies far from the center of the map get -1 accessibility, breaking trade and supply.
    With this update, accessibility now scales with sector size, so distant colonies stay connected.

        Example: On a 2× sector, the limit increases from 50 to 80 light-years.

    Fringe colonies are still harder to support — but no longer isolated.

Improved:
    Core Worlds can now be scaled independently from the rest of the sector (optional setting).

Extended:
    Maximum sector size and constellation size limits raised. Manual input allowed for extreme values.

Clarified:
    Mothership description updated to avoid confusion with modded alien content.

What this means for players:
    No more duplicate or missing star systems when starting new games.
    All vanilla and mod-added systems (like Limbo) appear where they are supposed to.
    Other mods that interact with hyperspace now work smoothly with Wide Horizons.
    Future terrain and effect features will be easier to add and remain stable.

Other:
    Numerous internal improvements to terrain detection, sector coordinates, and system placement.
    Most of these changes are “under the hood” and result in better stability and mod compatibility.

If you encounter issues with specific mods or missions after this update, please let us know on the forums or Discord at Taiwendo!

Version 1.0.7 (July 2025)

This change improves visual clarity around exotic stars and adds to the atmospheric structure of the sector.

Wide Horizons Update: Nexerelin Compatibility & Game Start Warning

Improved Compatibility:
    Wide Horizons now better supports Nexerelin and other sector-randomizing mods.

Random Sector Warning:
    If Nexerelin’s Random Sector Mode is enabled, you’ll see a clear warning message and will be returned to the main menu.
    Wide Horizons is only compatible with the standard (Corvus/Core) sector mode.

Prevents Broken Starts:
    This prevents issues with overlapping or misplaced systems and ensures a smoother gameplay experience.

Hyperspace Visuals Updated

    The galactic hyperspace nebula has been reworked for a more natural look:
        Nebula density now gradually fades toward the outer edges of the sector.
        The core region remains rich with spiral nebula patterns.
        Top and bottom edges thin out slightly earlier for better visibility.
        The lower-left region has been subtly enhanced to avoid overly empty space.

    Result: A more immersive and balanced galaxy, with smooth transitions from dense center to outer space.

More Natural Nebula Distribution
    Star systems with black holes or neutron stars will now no longer generate systemwide nebula.
    Their adjacent systems are also automatically cleared of nebula to create a more natural and coherent region.

Fixed:
    Systems from "Detected Machina Void Shipyards" are now generated and positioned correctly in the sector.
    Several HMI star systems (Opuntia, Kamikaze, Mercy, Obsidian) were not appearing at the correct locations in the sector map.
    Their positions now match the intended layout, just like in vanilla and other supported mods.

Version 1.0.6 (July 2025)

Core System Architecture Rework:

Foundation Rebuilt for Large-Scale Sector Support
    The internal structure for star system placement, registration, and alignment has been completely reworked.
    WideHorizons now uses a centralized framework to accurately reposition systems—Vanilla and modded—alongside their content, terrain, and static entities.

Content-Aware Positioning
    Systems are no longer just moved by coordinates: all attached entities (e.g., planets, stations, derelicts) are repositioned intelligently as part of the system structure.
    This ensures thematic consistency and visual accuracy across the entire sector.

Integrated Hyperspace Coordination
    Hyperspace terrain is now automatically adjusted around repositioned systems.
    Clearing logic respects final system locations and is synchronized with terrain generation, preventing fog collisions or obscured entrances in large sectors.

Fixed Position System Framework
    A new utility layer handles persistent placement of star systems across game sessions.
    Mod systems are only repositioned if they exist and are detected, ensuring safe and dynamic support for a wide range of external content.

Version Checker Integration
    WideHorizons now supports the Version Checker.
    You’ll be notified in the main menu whenever a new version of WideHorizons is available—no more guessing or missing important updates.

Fixed:
    Some systems (e.g. Mayasura) had misaligned stations, gates, or relays after being moved in the larger sector.
    This was caused by entities using fixed setLocation(...) coordinates without orbits, which did not follow the moved system center.
    Solution: All non-orbital system entities (e.g. gates, beacons, custom stations) are now automatically attached to their system’s star and follow correctly when the system is repositioned.
    Also excluded dynamic entities (like scanners, spawners or patrol anchors) from being locked to system centers, preserving intended behaviors.

Bugfixes and Improvements:
– Fixed crash caused by mismatched tile string length
– Prevented abyss regions from being overwritten during refill
– Added tile length validation for safe terrain initialization
– Reduced duplicate clearing calls for better performance
– Added terrain auto-initialization fallback

Improvements & Fixes:

Hyperspace Terrain Clearing and Refilling:
    Now the mod properly clears hyperspace nebula (“fog”) only around registered star systems and safely refills those areas on load. This prevents unwanted fog edits and improves navigation and visibility in a larger sector.

System Repositioning Stability:
    Star systems and their static entities are now consistently registered and repositioned based on saved coordinates, ensuring stable layouts after loading or sector generation. All non-orbital entities are auto-attached to the system’s star.

Developer Mode Logging:
    All internal logs are now gated behind Developer Mode. You’ll only see detailed debug output if DevMode is active, keeping the log clean during normal gameplay.

Central Logging via WHDevLogger:
    A new WHDevLogger utility handles all info, warn, and error output. It ensures consistent formatting, centralized control, and dev-mode-only output where appropriate.

Bugfixes and Internal Improvements:
– Fixed duplicate position updates caused by redundant system re-registration
– Ensured proper initialization of hyperspace terrain during generation and load
– Improved handling of abyss tiles to prevent invalid terrain overwrite
– Logging now includes tile debug info (before/after) for clear diagnostics
– Automatically skips auto-fix of dynamic entities to preserve AI and script behavior

What This Means for Players
– Clearer and more immersive hyperspace visuals around key systems
– Stable and reliable sector layout during both new game and reload
– Minimal log clutter unless actively debugging
– Improved performance and compatibility with terrain-related mods

Accurate System ID Matching
    System detection is now based on the actual Starsector-internal IDs, ensuring precise registration regardless of name capitalization or localization.
    Mods using duplicate system names (e.g., “Acheron”) are handled cautiously to avoid conflicts.

Duplicate System Protection
    Systems with identical IDs from multiple mods (like SCY and DPL) are safely checked before repositioning.
    Only one version is moved - whichever was actually created - preventing layout bugs or invisible systems.

Mod Detection-Based Placement
    Fixed system positioning is now fully conditional: systems are only repositioned if the corresponding mod is detected.
    This avoids errors and maintains a clean layout for each user’s mod setup.

Version 1.0.5 (July 2025)

Improved Compatibility with Popular Mods:

    Wide Horizons now detects fixed-position systems from many popular mods and repositions them correctly in the expanded sector.
        Better placement in the enlarged galaxy
        No more off-map or clipped systems
        A cleaner and more immersive sector map

Additional Improvements:
    Systems no longer drift or spawn late
    Mods that modify vanilla systems (like TTSC) are fully supported
    Hyperspace spiral shape refined and more centered

Abyss adjustments:
    Star systems no longer spawn inside the Abyss
    Abyss region now scales with sector size

Hyperspace cloud improvements:
    More visible paths across large maps
    Natural cloud distribution for better immersion

Note: These changes apply only to new savegames, since hyperspace is generated on game start. It's a visual improvement - gameplay is unaffected.

Bugfix: Invalid star types
    Mods using non-standard star types (e.g., star_purple) previously caused crashes during system expansion.
    Wide Horizons now replaces invalid stars with compatible types, or safely skips affected systems with proper logging.

Settings safety checks:
    Sector width, grid size, and other values are now validated
    Broken or extreme settings are corrected automatically

Version 1.0.4 (July 2025)

Bug Fixes:

    Auto mode reworked: Wide Horizons is now fully compatible with RAT in Auto mode.
    You now get both contents combined - RAT's sector logic plus all unique systems and features from Wide Horizons.

    Abyss zone fixed: Stars will no longer spawn inside the Abyss.
    The zone now also scales properly with larger sectors.

    Hyperspace cloud generation improved:
    Cloud and nebula distribution has been rebalanced for larger maps, offering better navigation and more natural density.

    Protection against invalid settings:
    New safety checks now prevent incorrect or illogical values (e.g. for sector size or grid setup) from breaking the game or causing performance issues.

Version 1.0.3 (June 2025)

Bug Fixes:

    Fixed Hyperspace Map Scaling.
    The hyperspace terrain now correctly matches the galaxy size, especially in larger sectors.

    No More Stars Leaking into the Abyss.
    Fixed an issue where some star systems (especially when using RAT) would spawn too close to or inside the Abyss region of the map.

    Improved Compatibility with Exotic Mods.
    Previously, certain modded stars (e.g. from Bultach Coalition) caused crashes due to missing or unsupported star data.
    Wide Horizons now includes a fallback system to handle these cases gracefully - and logs helpful messages if something unusual is detected.

    Crash Fixes for Extreme Settings.
    Fixed crashes that could occur when generating very large galaxies or using unrealistic system size values.

    Savegame-Safety Improvements.
    Additional compatibility work was done to reduce the risk of corrupted savegames when using other large content mods alongside Wide Horizons.

New Content & Features:

    Upgraded Hyperspace Generation.
    Visuals and layout of the hyperspace layer are now more immersive and better scaled for expanded galaxies.

    Bigger Star Systems.
    Systems can now be generated with more planets and expanded layouts - offering a greater sense of scale.

    Mysterious Dark Star Systems.
    A new type of system with unique effects and dark cosmic themes has been introduced. Can you find them?

    Refined Galaxy Layout.
    Adjusted system placement, scaling, and distribution - laying the foundation for upcoming content and themes.

Note:
Wide Horizons is still in active development - feedback and crash reports are appreciated!
Make sure you use the LunaLib in-game menu to customize your universe size, content density, and system behavior.

Version 1.0.1 (May 2025)

Improved Compatibility with RAT Mod:
    You can now choose whether to use universe generation settings from the "Random Assortment of Things" (RAT) mod or stick with Wide Horizons' own settings.
    This is fully configurable in-game via the LunaLib mod options menu.

Dynamic Universe Settings - No Restart Needed:
    Changes to galaxy size, number of star systems, gate density, and other settings are now applied immediately - no need to restart or reload.
    Make your adjustments in LunaLib and see the effects instantly in your next new game.

Smarter Galaxy Scaling:
    Sector size, system count, ruins, Remnant presence, and more now scale dynamically using a centralized "WH Scale" setting.
    This ensures consistent balance and flexibility for both small and massive universes.

Under-the-Hood Improvements:
    New plugin added to manage settings initialization and dynamic updates.
    Clean separation between RAT and Wide Horizons setting logic.
    Improved mod compatibility by exposing key galaxy values globally.

This update lays the groundwork for a more modular and customizable Wide Horizons experience.
Whether you prefer RAT's universe balance or Wide Horizons' handcrafted structure - now it's up to you.
