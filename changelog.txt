**Wide Horizons – Update Highlights v1.0.1**
**-----------------------------------------------------------------------**

Improved Compatibility with RAT Mod:

	You can now choose whether to use universe generation settings from the "Random Assortment of Things" (RAT) mod or stick with Wide Horizons' own settings.
	This is fully configurable in-game via the LunaLib mod options menu.

Dynamic Universe Settings – No Restart Needed:

	Changes to galaxy size, number of star systems, gate density, and other settings are now applied immediately — no need to restart or reload.
	Make your adjustments in LunaLib and see the effects instantly in your next new game.
	
Smarter Galaxy Scaling:

	Sector size, system count, ruins, Remnant presence, and more now scale dynamically using a centralized "WH Scale" setting.
	This ensures consistent balance and flexibility for both small and massive universes.

Under-the-Hood Improvements:

	New plugin added to manage settings initialization and dynamic updates
	Clean separation between RAT and Wide Horizons setting logic
	Improved mod compatibility by exposing key galaxy values globally

	This update lays the groundwork for a more modular and customizable Wide Horizons experience.
	Whether you prefer RAT’s universe balance or Wide Horizons’ handcrafted structure - now it’s up to you.

**Wide Horizons - Update Highlights v1.0.3**
**-----------------------------------------------------------------------**

Bug Fixes:

	Fixed Hyperspace Map Scaling
	The hyperspace terrain now correctly matches the galaxy size, especially in larger sectors.

	No More Stars Leaking into the Abyss
	Fixed an issue where some star systems (especially when using RAT) would spawn too close to or inside the Abyss region of the map.

	Improved Compatibility with Exotic Mods
	Previously, certain modded stars (e.g. from Bultach Coalition) caused crashes due to missing or unsupported star data.
	Wide Horizons now includes a fallback system to handle these cases gracefully - and logs helpful messages if something unusual is detected.

	Crash Fixes for Extreme Settings
	Fixed crashes that could occur when generating very large galaxies or using unrealistic system size values.

	Savegame-Safety Improvements
	Additional compatibility work was done to reduce the risk of corrupted savegames when using other large content mods alongside Wide Horizons.


New Content & Features:

	Upgraded Hyperspace Generation
	Visuals and layout of the hyperspace layer are now more immersive and better scaled for expanded galaxies.

	Bigger Star Systems
	Systems can now be generated with more planets and expanded layouts - offering a greater sense of scale.

	Mysterious Dark Star Systems
	A new type of system with unique effects and dark cosmic themes has been introduced. Can you find them?

	Refined Galaxy Layout
	Adjusted system placement, scaling, and distribution - laying the foundation for upcoming content and themes.


Note:
	Wide Horizons is still in active development - feedback and crash reports are appreciated!
	Make sure you use the LunaLib in-game menu to customize your universe size, content density, and system behavior.

**Wide Horizons - Update Highlights v1.0.4**
**-----------------------------------------------------------------------**

Bug Fixes:

	Auto mode reworked: Wide Horizons is now fully compatible with RAT in Auto mode.
	You now get both contents combined – RAT’s sector logic plus all unique systems and features from Wide Horizons.
	Abyss zone fixed: Stars will no longer spawn inside the Abyss. The zone now also scales properly with larger sectors.
	Hyperspace cloud generation improved: Cloud and nebula distribution has been rebalanced for larger maps, offering better navigation and more natural density.
	Protection against invalid settings: New safety checks now prevent incorrect or illogical values (e.g. for sector size or grid setup) from breaking the game or causing performance issues.

**Wide Horizons - Update Highlights v1.0.5**
**-----------------------------------------------------------------------**

Improved Compatibility with Popular Mods
Wide Horizons now detects fixed-position systems from many popular mods and repositions them correctly in the expanded sector.

    Better placement in the enlarged galaxy
    No more off-map or clipped systems
    A cleaner and more immersive sector map

Additional Improvements:

    Systems no longer drift or spawn late
    Mods that modify vanilla systems (like TTSC) are fully supported
    Hyperspace spiral shape refined and more centered


Abyss adjustments:

    Star systems no longer spawn inside the Abyss
    Abyss region now scales with sector size


Hyperspace cloud improvements:

    More visible paths across large maps
    Natural cloud distribution for better immersion

Note: These changes apply only to new savegames, since hyperspace is generated on game start. It’s a visual improvement – gameplay is unaffected.

Bugfix: Invalid star types

    Mods using non-standard star types (e.g., star_purple) previously caused crashes during system expansion.
    Wide Horizons now replaces invalid stars with compatible types, or safely skips affected systems with proper logging.


Settings safety checks:

    Sector width, grid size, and other values are now validated
    Broken or extreme settings are corrected automatically
