wh_black_project_intro_desc,CUSTOM,"Your battered fleet emerges from the nebula, hulls smoking and warnings blazing.","Twisted wrecks drift on ghostly trails, mementos of a covert UAF prototype mission.","Scans trace the ambush to a forbidden sector, whispered only in myth: the Dark Void.","Fragments of encrypted logs hint at a weapon beyond comprehension.","Only one ship remains intact—and you must uncover what lies at the heart of this conspiracy.","Prolog to Black Project"
wh_black_project_debris,CUSTOM,"Charred metal and shattered panels float among drifting cargo containers.","A half-buried data vault pulses with intermittent power surges.","Crimson stains on the bulkheads speak of last-ditch attempts to defend the mission.","Among the ruins, a solitary datapad lies miraculously intact—its screen flickers.","Its final entry reads: 'They came from within... and they never left.'","Remnants of a doomed expedition"

wh_void_pod_desc,CUSTOM,"A solitary pod adrift, half-submerged in the violet haze of hyperspace currents.","Its shell bears the burn-marks of forced egress, as if ripped from its home system.","Data cores lie shattered, their crystal matrices fractured beyond repair.","Yet deep within, a faint distress beacon pulses with an impossible cadence.","Stare too long and you swear you hear distant voices calling through the void.","Eerie probe of lost origin"
wh_pulse_probe_desc,CUSTOM,"A jagged probe oscillates in the darkness, each beat sending ripples through the void.","Bands of magenta plasma braid around its frame in unpredictable surges.","Sensors pick up echoes of a long-dead engine struggling to reignite.","Rumor claims its pulses resonate with the neural frequencies of ancient pilots.","Approach at your own risk—its rhythm can scramble both systems and minds.","Haunted pulse beacon"
wh_darkstar_void_system,CUSTOM,"An abyssal system lost to time, its dark star devours both light and memory.","Void Star","Its core absorbs all radiation, leaving only silence and gravitational warping."
wh_darkstar_pulse_system,CUSTOM,"Waves of radiation pulse from the star's core, disrupting sensors and stirring ancient echoes.","Pulse Star","This star emits violent flares that distort space itself."
wh_pulse_gate_anomaly,CUSTOM,"Entrance to a Pulse Star system: a rhythmic anomaly that flares like a heartbeat.","Waves of excited plasma and warped gravity roll outward, lighting the corridor in brief violet flashes.","During the high phase sensors spike and drift; during the low phase the channel steadies enough for a controlled approach.","Transit aligns the fleet with synchronized nodes and deposits vessels near the system's inner jump point.","Operators report repeating echoes buried in the noise floor, as if something calls back from inside.","WH: Pulse gate anomaly description v1"
wh_void_gate_anomaly,CUSTOM,"Entrance to a Void Star system: a cold sink that drinks light, heat, and signal.","The anomaly is less a tear than a hollow; background stars smear and bend around a lightless center.","Active scans fade into silence and hull plating runs cold as energy bleeds into the surrounding shadow.","Maintain course through the dark center; the corridor opens only when the absorbing aura slackens.","Probe logs mention motion without source beyond the event line; several pings never returned.","WH: Void gate anomaly description v1"
wh_dark_station,CUSTOM,"An ancient construction dock orbits in silence, its lights long extinguished.","","Only automated servitors remain malfunctioning, but still active."
wh_dark_planet_barren,CUSTOM,"A dead world, unshaped by civilization.",,"The wind and dust know no memory.","Lore: dark sector"
wh_dark_planet_bombarded,CUSTOM,"Once defiant, now reduced to glass.",,"Only magnetic echoes remain.","Lore: orbital fire"
wh_dark_planet_metallic,CUSTOM,"Iron, scarred and stripped.",,"The extraction wounds never healed.","Lore: deep mine"
wh_dark_planet_irradiated,CUSTOM,"It glows. Not warmly.",,"Approach only in leaded dreams.","Lore: stellar decay"
wh_dark_planet_toxic,CUSTOM,"Poison in every breath and stone.",,"Decay begets decay.","Lore: failed industry"
